This repository serves as the central place for storing design assets.

The **Brand book** documents the visual identity of P2PU and serves as a guide for creating new resources.

# Assets

 - Brand book

# A note on file formats for printable assets

Whenever new assets are created, the original file (source format) and a printable format are added to this repository.

**Source files** are always included in an open file format (like SVG) so modifications can be made in the future without the need for non-free software. Text are kept as SVG text and all fonts that deviate from the Brandbook are noted.

**Printable files** are saved as PDF with all fonts converted to paths.
